# DAG-RNG
Meta-DAG RNG: A novel random number generator combining transcendental numbers (π, e, φ, etc.) with dynamic graph structures. Uses self-modifying operations and evolving network paths to generate high-quality random numbers. Features built-in health monitoring and pure mathematical foundations with natural entropy sources.
